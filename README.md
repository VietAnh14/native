# Native Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/foodtiny/native.svg?token=p64HTBqDyw43Lh5iDLxP&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/foodtiny/native)

This library provides set of functions which are common used in C/C++ application.
Beside C standard library, we would like to have a greater performance and custom optimization and easier to remember

### Standard Library
- General (length, append, join, segment, sort & search)
- Compression (gzip)
- Cryptography (md5, sha1, base64)
- Datetime (time format)
- Network (http, ip address)
- Storage (file)
- String (converter, processor)
- Threading (multiple threading, timer)
- Validation (phone, email, url)
- Data type (json)
- Third Party Client (Twillio, SendGrid, Etcd, Elastic Search, Stripe, Apple/Google Push Notification)

### Assembly Optimization
This library is originally developed in C but we still can make things go faster by optimizing in GNU Assembly.
Note that GNU Assembly is ONLY work with Linux AMD64. No need to optimize performance for Apple MacOSX because only development.
